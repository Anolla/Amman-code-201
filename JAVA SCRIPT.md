### JavaScript 
it can be used in browsers to make websites more interactive,
interesting, and user-friendly

- jQuery makes writing javascript easier

- To write a script, you need to first
state your goal and then list the
tasks that need to be completed using a flowcharts:

1- DEFINE THE GOAL
2- DESIGN THE SCRIPT
3- CODE EACH STEP

- And then these steps can be translated into individual lines of code,
as the copmuter needs you to demonstrate every step to get the needed result. 


### Expressions

there are two types of expressions:
1- EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A
VALUE TO A VARIABLE
2- EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR
MORE VALUES TO RETURN A
SINGLE VALUE


### Functions

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).

- To create a function you need to:
Declare the function 
Have parametes (optoinal).
Return value.
