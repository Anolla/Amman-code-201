Text Editors

Most of text editors have similar features and functions, that's why the best text editor is a personal choise. 

but usually a good text editor has to have these features:
1- code completion to save you time.
2- Emmet to speed up writing HTML and CSS.
3-syntax highlighting for coloring the text which helps to differentiate between code types.
4- A theme that is comfortable for the eyes.
5-Extensions so you can code in a more functional way.

By default, windows has Notepad a s text editor but it's pretty basic and doesn't have alot of features as the other text editors.
