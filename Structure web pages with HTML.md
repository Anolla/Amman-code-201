# Structuring with HTML




#### It's important to understand who your target audienceis, why they would come to your site, what informationthey want to find and when they are likely to return.
- Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.- Wireframes allow you to organize the information thatwill need to go on each page.
- Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helpsvisitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
- You can differentiate between pieces of informationusing size, color, and style.
- You can use grouping and similarity to help simplifythe information you present.

#### The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose ofdifferent parts of a web page and help to describeits structure.- The new elements provide clearer code (comparedwith using multiple <div> elements).
- Older browsers that do not understand HTML5elements need to be told which elements areblock-level elements.
- To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,which is available free from Google

#### DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML youare using.
- You can add comments to your code between the<!-- and --> markers.
- The id and class attributes allow you to identifyparticular elements.
- The <div> and <span> elements allow you to groupblock-level and inline elements together.
- <iframes> cut windows into your web pages throughwhich other pages can be displayed.
- The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds ofinformation about your web page.
- Escape characters are used to include specialcharacters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.
